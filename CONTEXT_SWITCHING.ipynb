        "### **1. What is Context Switching?**\n",
        "Context switching is the process of **saving the state** of a currently running process and **loading the state** of another process. This allows the CPU to switch between multiple processes quickly, making it appear as if they are running simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ”¹ **Example:**\n",
        "Imagine you are watching a YouTube video, downloading a file, and writing notes in Notepad. The OS keeps switching between these tasks so fast that you feel like everything is running at the same time.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. How Does an OS Handle Multiple Tasks?**\n",
        "The OS uses **time-sharing** where each process gets a small time slice (a few milliseconds). The OS scheduler determines which process gets CPU time and when.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **On a single-core processor**:  \n",
        "  - Only **one** task runs at a time.\n",
        "  - The OS switches between tasks rapidly.\n",
        "  - This creates an illusion of multitasking.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **On a multi-core processor**:  \n",
        "  - True parallel execution happens.\n",
        "  - Each core runs a separate process simultaneously.\n",
        "  - Context switching still occurs when there are more processes than available cores.\n",

        "1. The CPU starts executing **Task A** for 5ms.\n",
        "2. The OS **saves the state** of Task A and switches to **Task B**.\n",
        "3. After 5ms, the OS switches to **Task C**, saving Task Bâ€™s state.\n",
