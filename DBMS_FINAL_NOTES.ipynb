        "\n",
        "1. **What is 3PC?**\n",
        "   - A distributed transaction protocol that ensures all participating nodes agree on whether to commit or abort a transaction.\n",
        "   - Adds an extra phase compared to 2PC to handle failures more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why Use 3PC?**\n",
        "   - Prevents system-wide blocking if the coordinator or any participant fails.\n",
        "   - Improves fault tolerance compared to 2PC.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Phases of 3PC**\n",
        "   The protocol is divided into three phases:\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### **Phase 1: CanCommit**\n",
        "   - **Coordinator** asks all participants: \"Can you commit the transaction?\"\n",
        "   - Participants check if they are ready to commit (e.g., resources are available, no conflicts).\n",
        "   - Each participant replies with a **Yes** or **No**.\n",
        "     - If any participant says **No**, the transaction is aborted.\n",
        "     - If all participants say **Yes**, the protocol proceeds to the next phase.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### **Phase 2: PreCommit**\n",
        "   - **Coordinator** sends a **PreCommit** message to all participants.\n",
        "   - Participants prepare to commit by:\n",
        "     - Locking resources.\n",
        "     - Writing logs for recovery.\n",
        "   - Participants reply with an acknowledgment (**ACK**) to the coordinator.\n",
        "     - If any participant fails to acknowledge, the transaction is aborted.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### **Phase 3: DoCommit**\n",
        "   - **Coordinator** sends a **DoCommit** message to all participants.\n",
        "   - Participants finalize the transaction by:\n",
        "     - Committing changes to the database.\n",
        "     - Releasing locks.\n",
        "   - Participants send a final acknowledgment to the coordinator.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Handling Failures**\n",
        "   - If the **coordinator** fails during the **CanCommit** phase, participants assume the transaction is aborted.\n",
        "   - If the **coordinator** fails during the **PreCommit** phase, participants wait for a timeout and then decide based on their logs.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **What is a Log?**\n",
        "   - A log is a record of all changes made to the database by transactions.\n",
        "   - Each log entry contains:\n",
        "     - Transaction ID (e.g., $ T_1, T_2 $).\n",
        "     - Data item being modified (e.g., $ A, B $).\n",
        "     - Old value (before the change).\n",
        "     - New value (after the change).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Purpose of Logs**\n",
        "   - To track all changes made by transactions before they are applied to the database.\n",
        "   - To help recover the database after a failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Rule**\n",
        "   - Before any change is made to the database, it must first be written to the log.\n",
        "   - Ensures that logs are safely stored on disk before applying changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Types of Log Entries**\n",
        "   - `<T, Start>`: Indicates the start of transaction $ T $.\n",
        "   - `<T, X, old_value, new_value>`: Records the update of data item $ X $.\n",
        "   - `<T, Commit>`: Marks successful completion of transaction $ T $.\n",

        "   - Data stays on local devices (like smartphones or IoT devices) instead of being sent to a central server.\n",
        "   - Devices collaborate to improve the model while keeping their data private.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why is Federated Learning Important?**\n",
        "   - Protects user privacy by keeping sensitive data (e.g., health info, facial images) on local devices.\n",
        "   - Helps comply with privacy laws like GDPR, CCPA, and CLPR.\n",
        "   - Reduces the risk of data leakage or misuse.\n",

        "   - Multiple devices (or organizations) train a shared machine learning model locally using their own data.\n",
        "   - Only the model updates (not the raw data) are sent to a central server.\n",

        "The **Triple Model** is a data representation framework inspired by **RDF (Resource Description Framework)** but adapted for **dataspace applications**. It organizes information into **triples**, each consisting of a **subject**, **predicate**, and **object**, forming a flexible graph structure. Here's a breakdown:\n",

        "### **1. What is the Triple Model?**\n",
        "- **Definition**:\n",
        "  - The triple model organizes data into **triples**:  \n",
        "    - **Subject**: The entity being described (e.g., a file, person, or database record).  \n",
        "    - **Predicate**: The attribute or relationship (e.g., \"Name,\" \"Size,\" or \"born-in\").  \n",
        "    - **Object**: The value of the attribute or related entity (e.g., \"report.pdf,\" 1024, or \"1879-03-14\").\n",
        "  - Triples form a **loosely connected, edge-labeled directed graph**, allowing flexible integration of diverse data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Purpose**:\n",
        "  - Designed to handle **any type of data**: structured (e.g., database records), semi-structured (e.g., XML), or unstructured (e.g., text documents).\n",
        "  - Supports the **pay-as-you-go philosophy** of dataspaces, where semantic differences are resolved incrementally rather than upfront.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Advantages**:\n",
        "  - **Simple yet powerful**: Easy to transform and merge data compared to complex models.\n",

        "3. **Schema-Free Design**:\n",
        "   - No predefined schema is required; triples can be appended freely.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Query Flexibility**:\n",
