        "\n",
        "The **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)** is a **distributed algorithm** that coordinates all the processes involved in a transaction across multiple nodes (servers, databases, etc.) to ensure that **either all of them commit the transaction or none of them do**.\n",
        "\n",
        "It ensures **ACID properties**, especially **Atomicity and Consistency**, in distributed environments.\n",
        "\n",

        "## üîÑ Overview of 2PC\n",
        "\n",
        "2PC involves two main phases:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Prepare Phase (Voting Phase)**\n",
        "2. **Commit Phase (Decision Phase)**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two types of participants:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Coordinator (Transaction Manager):** Initiates the transaction and makes the final decision.\n",
        "- **Participants (Resource Managers/Nodes):** The individual databases or services involved in the transaction.\n",

        "\n",
        "### ‚è© Steps:\n",
        "1. The **coordinator** sends a **\"prepare\" message** to all participants.\n",
        "2. Each participant checks if it can safely commit the transaction.\n",
        "   - If yes, it writes **undo and redo logs** (for recovery).\n",
        "   - Then, it replies with a **\"ready\"** message.\n",
        "3. If a participant cannot commit (e.g., due to failure or resource lock), it sends an **\"abort\"** message.\n",
