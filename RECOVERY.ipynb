        "\n",
        "### **Types of Recovery Techniques:**\n",
        "1. **Deferred Update** – Changes are applied after transaction commit.\n",
        "2. **Immediate Update** – Changes are applied instantly but can be undone.\n",
        "3. **Shadow Paging** – Uses a shadow copy for transaction safety.\n",

        "## **2. Deferred Update (Deferred Write)**\n",
        "### **Concept:**  \n",
        "- Changes made by a transaction are **not applied** to the database until the transaction commits.\n",
        "- Before commit, changes are stored in a **log file (Transaction Log)**.\n",
        "- If the system fails before the commit, **no rollback is required** since changes were never applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Steps in Deferred Update:**  \n",
        "1. Transaction begins.\n",
        "2. All changes are recorded in a **log file** (not in the database).\n",
        "3. If the transaction commits, changes are written to the database.\n",
        "4. If the transaction fails, no changes are applied (rollback is unnecessary).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example:**  \n",
        "- A transaction updates an **account balance** from ₹50,000 to ₹60,000.\n",

        "- The **original page** remains unchanged until the transaction commits.  \n",
        "- If the transaction commits, the shadow pages become active.  \n",
