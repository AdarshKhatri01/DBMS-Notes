        "A **transaction** is a sequence of one or more database operations (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`) executed as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that the database remains **consistent and reliable**, even in the event of system failures.  \n",

        "# **ACID Properties of Transactions**  \n",
        "To maintain **database integrity and reliability**, transactions follow the **ACID properties**:  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Atomicity (A)** â€“ *All or nothing!*  \n",
        "   - Either **all** operations in a transaction execute successfully, or **none** of them are applied.  \n",
        "   - Example: If money is deducted from Account A but not credited to Account B due to a failure, the whole transaction is rolled back.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Consistency (C)** â€“ *Database remains valid before and after the transaction.*  \n",
        "   - A transaction ensures that the database remains in a valid state, following all integrity constraints.  \n",
        "   - Example: If a transaction deducts â‚¹1000 from A, it must **add â‚¹1000 to B**, ensuring no data is lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Isolation (I)** â€“ *Transactions do not interfere with each other.*  \n",
        "   - If multiple transactions run at the same time, they should not affect each otherâ€™s execution.  \n",
        "   - Example: If two users transfer money at the same time, one transaction should **not see** half-completed changes of the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Durability (D)** â€“ *Once committed, the changes are permanent.*  \n",
        "   - Even if a system crash occurs after a transaction is committed, the changes **must not be lost**.  \n",
        "   - Example: If â‚¹1000 is transferred successfully and the system crashes, the transfer should **not be reversed**.\n",

        "  4. **Phantom Read** â€“ A transaction reads a different number of rows in two reads due to another transaction inserting/deleting records.\n",

        "- **Concurrency Control Techniques:**\n",
        "  1. **Lock-based Protocols**:\n",

        "  2. **Timestamp-based Protocols**:\n",

        "  3. **Optimistic Concurrency Control**:\n",
        "     - Transactions proceed without restrictions and are validated before committing.\n",
